Spelling
========
Spelling is a Light Table plugin that provides spell checking with
[hunspell][1] dictionaries and [Typo.js][2].  It is available in the
Light Table plugin repository, or you can clone this repository into
your plugins folder.

Usage
-----
Spelling requires you to already have the hunspell `.aff` and `.dic`
files for your language on your system.  By default, it looks for these
files in `/usr/share/hunspell/`, which is the default for some Linux
systems.  If yours are stored elsewhere, you can point Spelling towards
them by adding to your `user.behaviors` file:
```clojure
[:app :lt.plugins.spelling/set-dictionary-location "/path/containing/dicts"]
```

On Windows use the following path syntax ```"/Program Files (x86)/Mozilla Firefox/dictionaries"```

Note that hunspell dictionaries are used by Firefox, LibreOffice, and
many others, so you likely have them on your system already.  If not,
you can download dictionaries for your language from [LibreOffice][3].
(Windows users are reminded that backslashes need to be escaped in the
behaviors file, so write `\\` to get a single backslash in your path.
You may also use forward slashes in place of backslashes.)

Spelling provides commands to turn spell checking on and off on the
current editor.  If the environmental variable `$LANG` is set, it is
used as the default language.  Otherwise, the first dictionary found is
used.  The "Set language" command will change the language for the
current editor to the language code you provide.

Spell checking can be automatically enabled for certain file types by
adding the `:lt.plugins.spelling/enable` or
`:lt.plugins.spelling/enable-lang <code>` behaviors to the
appropriate tags.  For example, to enable spell checking in the default
language in all TeX files, add to your `user.behaviors` file:
```clojure
[:editor.latex :lt.plugins.spelling/enable]
```

There are two modes Spelling uses to determine which words should be
spellchecked.  In the default mode, aimed at programming languages, it
checks only comments and strings.  In its markup language mode, all
strings except commands are checked.  This mode is indicated by the
presence of the `:editor.spelling.markup` tag.  By default, HTML, XML,
Markdown, LaTeX, and plain text files are given this tag.  To indicate
that editors with the tag `:foo` should use markup mode, add to your
`user.behaviors` file:
```clojure
[:foo :lt.object/add-tag :editor.spelling.markup]
```
